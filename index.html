      <h3>Bears are neat!</h3>
      <p>Bears are mammals that belong to the family Ursidae. They can be as small as four feet long and about 60 pounds
        (the sun bear) to as big as eight feet long and more than a thousand pounds (the polar bear). They're found throughout North America,
        South America, Europe, and Asia.</p>
      <p>They have nonretractable claws, short tails, and excellenet sense of small. They're typically solitary, except for mothers with cubs.
        There are eight species: Asiatic black bears (also called moon bears), brown bears (which include grizzly bears), giant pandas, North 
        American Black bears, polar bears, sloth bears, spectacled bears (also called Andean bears), and sun bears.</p>
      <p>On average, bears can live up to 25 years in the wild and 50 in captivity. Six species, including the polar bear and giant panda are included pn the IUCN
        Red List as threatened or vulnerable
